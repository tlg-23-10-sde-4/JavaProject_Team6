# Taco Cat Goat Cheese Pizza

## An Attempt at a Popular Children's Game in Java

Our group attempted to bring the lively children's game [Taco Cat Goat Cheese Pizza](https://www.cardhaus.com/taco-cat-goat-cheese-pizza/) to life on your computer. 

## Implementation

1. We started by having a [conversation](resources/READMEReferences/TCGCP%20Conversation.txt) about how the game plays out: which thing does what (and to whom). 
2. We built our [first UML](resources/READMEReferences/ClassDiagram_20231115%20-%20few%20fields.jpg) diagram based off of this conversation.
3. We refined that UML, realizing the Hand class could instead be a field within Player, and that we could combine Dealer and Deck. Alas, that product wasn't captured.

4. We spent considerable time attempting to refine our understanding of the game flow, objects, actions, and relationships.

    [#2](resources/READMEReferences/Model%20Classes%20based%20on%20current%20UML.txt)
    [#3](resources/READMEReferences/procedures.txt)
    [#4](resources/READMEReferences/Class-Method%20Structure.txt)

5. We finally started coding. About a day later we identified a need [to track all the different fields/methods we were using](resources/READMEReferences/TCGCP%20Classes,%20Methods,%20Fields.xlsx) to provide a common language.

6. And we were stuck in a loop of writing, editing, discussing for the next 3+ days.

## Final Product aka Challenges

While we did get a working product, we did not come close to meeting our aspirational goals outlined in our conversation.

## Lessons

1. We would have benefited greatly from an experienced team lead. Every conversation we had with Jay catapulted us forward for a short time; we proceeded at a glacial pace otherwise.
