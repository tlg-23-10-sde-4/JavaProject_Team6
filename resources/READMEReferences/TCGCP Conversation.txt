TCGCP

PT1

1. There is a deck with 64 cards - how many of each card?

2. Dealer deals all cards evenly between number of players (2-8)

Players don't know their cards

3. Any leftover cards are discarded from the game

4. All cards facedown in front of player

PT2

1. Flip over the top card of your (player to the left of the dealer) pile and places the card into the middle. 

2. Player 1 says the next of "Taco, Cat, Goat, Cheese, Pizza", starting with "Taco"

3. If the card matches the word, slap the pile

4. Last player to slap the deck receives the pile

5. If the player 1's card doesn't match the word, play passes to the left

6. Repeat steps 2-5 with the next player. Iterate until 7.
	a. Unless #4; the player who loses the slap starts.

7. Player who runs out of cards first wins






OPTIONAL

Easy/Medium/Hard modes

Incorporate Narwhal, Gorilla, etc...

When erroneous slap occurs, that player picks up the pile

Elaborate GUI

Scoreboard showing how many cards you (and other players?) have left in each round

Scoreboard showing wins/player and other statistical coolness?
