Taco, Cat, Goat, Cheese, Pizza!

Keep this crazy string of words in mind.

As soon as there is a match between a card and a spoken word,
race to "slap" the pile of cards.  Just don't be last!

The last person to do so must take them all!


Game Play:

1) Game starts when Player 1 says: "Taco" and flips their top card, discarding into
    the center pile.
2) If there is no match, Player 2 says: "Cat" and flips their top card in to the center pile.

3) This continues until there is a match between card flipped and what player says.

4) When there is a match, Everyone SLAPS!

As long as you aren't last, you won't collect up all the cards in the pile.

REMEMBER:
Get rid of all your cards and don't be the last to slap.

GOOD LUCK!!!
